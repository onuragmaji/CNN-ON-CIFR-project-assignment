# CNN-ON-CIFR-project-assignment
This is one of assignment i did under guidence of @applied ai course .



Project involves  CIFAR-10 dataset which consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.


I used image augmentation techniques which creates regularization by completely avoiding dropouts.
